🛠️ System taggers:

* [Atomizer](atomizer.ipynb) forgets the parent of the input layer.
* [CombinedTagger](combined_tagger.ipynb) runs input taggers in parallel and resolves conflicts.
* [DiffTagger](diff_tagger.ipynb) compares two layers and  outputs all the differences.
* [Disambiguator](disambiguator.ipynb) provides a function-based disambiguation for an ambiguous layer.
* [GapTagger](gaps_tagging.ipynb) tag gaps in input layers.
* [MergeTagger](merge_tagger.ipynb) merges input layers.
* [TaggerTester](tagger_tester.ipynb) method helps to create test files for taggers.
