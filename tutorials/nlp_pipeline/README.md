NLP components
============

This folder contains tutorials about EstNLTK's natural language processing (NLP) components. 
While many of the components are part of the default pipeline (callable via _default resolver_), some components are also stand-alone and need to be imported from specific paths.

* [introduction_to_nlp_pipeline.ipynb](../basics/introduction_to_nlp_pipeline.ipynb) gives an overview about how to use EstNLTK for basic text analysis: splitting text into tokens, words, sentences, and performing morphological analysis (including lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging).

* [A_text_segmentation](A_text_segmentation/) tutorials give details about segmenting texts into tokens, compound tokens, words, sentences, paragraphs and clauses.

* [B_morphology](B_morphology/) tutorials describe morphological analysis tools (Vabamorf, text-based and corpus-based disambiguator, user dictionary tagger, GT converter and HFST-based analyser), morphological synthesis, spelling correction and syllabification.

* [C_syntax](C_syntax/) tutorials give information about preprocessing for syntactic analysis and syntactic analysers, available models and utilities to comparing and validating syntactic annotations.

* [D_information_extraction](D_information_extraction/) tutorials describe how to extract addresses, named entities and temporal expressions from texts.

* [E_embeddings](E_embeddings/) tutorials describe pre-trained language models / embeddings available for Estonian.

* [X_miscellaneous](X_miscellaneous/) and experimental language analysers: verb chain detector, noun phrase chunker, date and number taggers for medical texts,  adjective phrase tagger and Flesch reading ease score tagger.
