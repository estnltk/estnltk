NLP components
============

This folder contains tutorials about EstNLTK's natural language processing (NLP) components and utilities.
While many of the components are part of the main pipeline (callable via _default resolver_), some components are also stand-alone and need to be imported from specific paths.

* [introduction_to_nlp_pipeline.ipynb](introduction_to_nlp_pipeline.ipynb) gives an overview of how to use EstNLTK for the basic analysis of text: splitting it into tokens, words, sentences, and performing morphological analysis (which includes lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging).

* [A_text_segmentation](A_text_segmentation/) tutorials give detailed information about  text segmentation tasks: splitting text into tokens, compound tokens, words, sentences, paragraphs and clauses. 

* [B_morphology](B_morphology/) tutorials describe morphological analysis tools (Vabamorf, text-based and corpus-based disambiguator, user dictionary tagger, GT converter and HFST-based analyser), morphological synthesis, spelling correction and syllabification.

* [C_syntax](C_syntax/) tutorials give information about preprocessing for syntactic parsing and syntactic parsers, available models and utilities.

* [D_information_extraction](D_information_extraction/) tutorials describe taggers for extracting addresses, named entities and temporal expressions from texts.

* [E_miscellaneous](E_miscellaneous/) tutorials describe experimental language analysers, such as verb chain detector and noun phrase chunker.
