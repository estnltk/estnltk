    "### Details of the parse_enc module\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reconstruction of source text\n",
    "\n",
    "The Estonian National Corpus contains a variety of subcorpora, and its documents have gone through different degrees of editing, normalization and automatic (XML/HTML) annotation clean-up. \n",
    "Many of the original plain texts are no longer available, so texts need to be reconstructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `parse_enc_file_iterator` reconstructs texts from available annotation clues. \n",
    "If there are paragraphs (texts between `<p>` and `</p>` tags)  in the original document, these will be concatenated by double newlines.\n",
    "Sentences (texts between `<s>` and `</s>` tags) in the original document will be concatenated by a single whitespace.\n",
    "And words/tokens will also be concatenated by a single whitespace, except when there are `<g/>` tags between tokens.\n",
    "Tokens separated by `<g/>` will be joined together into a single word, for instance, the token sequence `['\"', '<g/>', 'Õnne', '13', '<g/>', '\"']` will be reconstructed as string `\"Õnne 13\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, only words that have morphological analyses will be used for text reconstruction. If there are XML/HTML tags inside the document, these will not be included in the reconstructed text (unless they have been, \"by accident\", morphologically analysed).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Signature of the parsing function\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`parse_enc_file_iterator`**`(in_file, encoding='utf-8', focus_doc_ids=None, focus_srcs=None, focus_lang=None,  tokenization='preserve', original_layer_prefix='original_', restore_morph_analysis=False, restore_syntax=False, vertParser=None, textReconstructor=None, line_progressbar=None, logger=None)` -- reads and parses Estonian National Corpus .vert file (`in_file`). \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`encoding`** -- encoding of the input file. Normally, you should go with the default value ('utf-8').\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`focus_doc_ids`** -- set of document id-s corresponding to the documents which need to be extracted from the `in_file`. Used for filtering documents by metadata attribute `id`. **Important:** `focus_doc_ids` should be a set of strings, not a set of integers. If provided, then only documents with given id-s will be  processed, and all other documents will be skipped. If `focus_doc_ids` is `None` or empty set, then document processing will not be affected by the given filter (but it may be affected by other filters). (default: `None`).\n",

Potential source values for ENC 2017 are: `'NC'`, `'web13'`, `'web17'`, `'wiki17'`. Potential values for ENC 2019 are: `Web 2013`, `'Web 2019'`, `'Web 2017'`, `'DOAJ'`, `'Wikipedia 2017'`, `'Wikipedia 2019'`, `'Reference Corpus'` and `'Balanced Corpus'`. If set is provided, then only documents that have a src value from the set will be extracted, and all other documents will be skipped. If `focus_srcs` is `None` or empty, then document processing will not be affected by the given filter (but it may be affected by other filters).  (default: `None`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`focus_lang`** -- set of allowed document languages. Used for filtering documents by metadata attribute `lang`. If provided, then only documents that have `lang` from the set will be extracted, and all other documents will be skipped. Note that if `focus_lang` is set, but the document does not have `lang` attribute, then the document is also be skipped. If `focus_lang` is `None` or empty, then document processing will not be affected by the given filter (but it may be affected by other filters).  (default: `None`).\n",

    "   * As of Estnltk v1.7.1, the function **`parse_enc_file_iterator`** attempts to _automatically fix malformed paragraph annotations_ . As a result, paragraphs layer will be added to every document. If the original document did not have any paragraphs (`<p> ... </p>` tags), then the paragraphs layer will have 1 paragraph which contains all the sentences of the document. If document contains malformed paragraphs, then the following fixes will be applied: **A)** first sentence `<s>...</s>` that does not belong to any paragraph will be a start of a new paragraph; **B)** a sentence `<s>...</s>` following tag `</p>` will be a start of a new paragraph.\n",

    "By default, this reconstruction follows the original XML mark-up: paragraphs (texts between`<p>` and `</p>` tags in the original XML) will be separated by double newlines, sentences (texts between `<s>` and `</s>` tags in the XML) will be separated by newlines, and words will be separated by whitespaces in the constructed texts.\n",
    "Optionally, you may also add tokenization layers to created `Text` objects: either by strictly following the original XML tokenization mark-up, or by adding tokenization with EstNLTK's tools.\n",

Returns a list of created `Text` objects;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact behaviour of the functions can be modified by the following common arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`target`** -- specifies the list of types of divs, from which the textual content is to be extacted. For instance, in case of newspaper articles, the content of an article is typically between `<div3 type=\"artikkel\">` and `</div3>`, so, you should use `target=['artikkel']`. In case of fiction writings, the content of a single work is typically between `<div1 type=\"tervikteos\">` and `</div1>`, and you may want to use `target=['tervikteos']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Which values should be used for `target` depend on the subcorpus and the goal of analysis. For example, you may want to divide a fiction text into chapters, instead of analysing it as a whole. In such case, you should manually look up the correct type values (for chapters) from the concrete XML file.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  If you do not have very specific goals, you can use the function **`get_div_target()`**, which provides a reasonable default div type for the given XML file, based on the hard-coded values. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from estnltk.corpus_processing.parse_koondkorpus import get_div_target\n",
    "from estnltk.corpus_processing.parse_koondkorpus import parse_tei_corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "xml_file = 'C:\\\\Eesti_ilukirjandus\\\\ilukirjandus\\\\Eesti_ilukirjandus_1990\\\\'+\\\n",
    "           'ilu_ahasveerus.tasak.xml'\n",

    "docs = parse_tei_corpus( xml_file, target=[target] )\n",
    "```\n",
    "   Note: the function `get_div_target()` needs name of the xml file with full path, as it uses information from directory names for determining the div type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`add_tokenization`** -- specifies whether the tokenization layers (`'tokens'`, `'compound_tokens'`, `'words'`, `'sentences'`, and `'paragraphs'`) should be added to newly created Text objects (default: False). Note that if `preserve_tokenization==False`, then the tokenization layers are added with EstNLTK's tools, otherwise the original layers from the XML mark-up are preserved;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`preserve_tokenization`** -- specifies if the original word, sentence and paragraph tokenization from the XML mark-up should be preserved (default: False). This only works if `add_tokenization` is switched on. Then `Text` objects are created with layers `'tokens'`, `'compound_tokens'`, `'words'`, `'sentences'` and `'paragraphs'`, which preserve the original tokenization. This means that paragraphs are taken from between `<p>` and `</p>` tags, sentences from between `<s>` and `</s>` tags, and words are taken as space-separated tokens inside the sentences. The layer `'compound_tokens'` will always remain empty (because there is no information about token compounding in the XML mark-up), and the layer `'tokens'` will be equal to the layer `'words'`;\n",
    "\n",
    "     _Note_: Creating tokenization layers typically takes more processing time than loading `Text` objects without layers. If you do not change parameters `sentence_separator` and `paragraph_separator`, then reconstructed texts also preserve the hints about tokenization, and you can restore the original tokenization afterwards. See the remark **C** below for details;\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "* **`record_xml_filename`** -- specifies if the name of XML file should recorded in the metadata of the created `Text` objects, under the key `'_xml_file'` (default: False);\n",

    "* **`encoding`** -- encoding of the input file (or input files). Normally, you should go with the default value ('utf-8').\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`sentence_separator`** -- string used as sentence separator during the reconstruction of the text (default: `'\\n'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`paragraph_separator`** -- string used as paragraph separator during the reconstruction of the text (default: `'\\n\\n'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`orig_tokenization_layer_name_prefix`** -- string used as a prefix in names of layers of original tokenization. You can use this argument to make names of original tokenization layers distinguishable from EstNLTK's tokenization layers. (default: `''`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What to keep in mind when using the loading functions\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **A.** Functions `parse_tei_corpus` and `parse_tei_corpora` provide a simple and general solution to loading texts from XML TEI failes. The textual content (and also metadata, up to an extent) can be loaded from any subcorpus of the Estonian Reference Corpus. However, the genericity has a cost: typically, corpus-specific markings will not be loaded. For instance, the corpus of Estonian parliamentary transcripts also contains special markings for speaker names, but this information is not loaded. And the corpus of Internet forums also records time and user name for each forum message, but only the message itself (the textual content) is loaded.\n",
    " \n",
    "   If you need to \"get more out of\" the XML TEI files, you'll need to create your own loading functions. You can follow the example of the functions in the module `estnltk.corpus_processing.parse_koondkorpus`, and use the library [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to do the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **B.** _Tokenization_: adding EstNLTK's tokenization vs preserving the original tokenization. \n",
    "   \n",
    "      1. If you use EstNLTK's tokenization instead of the original one, you get annotations of multiword tokens (`'compound_tokens'`), and this also helps to get more accurate sentence annotations. For instance, the original markup occasionally contains sentence endings inside multiword names, such as _'Ju. M. Lotman'_, and date expressions, such as _'24 . 10. 1921'_, but EstNLTK's default tokenization marks such expressions as `'compound_tokens'` and thus cancels sentence endings inside these expressions. If you use EstNLTK's tokenization, it is advisable also to set `sentence_separator=' '`, so that reconstructed text will not contain newlines inside compound tokens;\n",
    "    \n",
    "      2. If you preserve the original tokenization, you can get better alignment with other linguistic annotations laid on the loaded corpus, such as [Dependency Treebank annotations](https://github.com/EstSyntax/EDT), or [TimeML annotations](https://github.com/soras/EstTimeMLCorpus). Data also gets loaded faster with the original tokenization annotations. The downsides are: there will be no `'compound_tokens'` marked in loaded texts, and there may be more sentence tokenization errors;\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   * **C.** _Loading texts without tokenization, and then restoring the original tokenization later._ If you use parameters `sentence_separator` and `paragraph_separator` with their default values, you can restore the original tokenization after loading the texts. For this:\n",
    "   \n",
    "      1. Use a `CompoundTokenTagger` with initialization parameter `do_not_join_on_strings=['\\n', '\\n\\n']` to ensure that compound tokens will not cross out sentence and paragraph endings;\n",
    "      2. Use a  `SentenceTokenizer` with the `base_sentence_tokenizer` set to NLTK's `LineTokenizer()`, so that texts will be split to sentences following newlines;\n",
    "      3. Use the default paragraph tokenizer to create paragraphs according to the original paragraph tokenization;"
