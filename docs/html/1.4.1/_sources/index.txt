Estnltk -- Open source tools for Estonian natural language processing
=====================================================================

Estnltk provides common natural language processing functionality such
as paragraph, sentence and word tokenization, morphological analysis,
named entity recognition, etc. for the Estonian language.

The project is funded by EKT (Eesti Keeletehnoloogia Riiklik Programm,
https://www.keeletehnoloogia.ee/).

Installation
------------

The recommended way of installing estnltk is by using the `anaconda
python distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__ and python
3.5+.

We have installable packages built for osx, windows-64, and linux-64.

The command for installing estnltk is:

::

    conda install -c estnltk -c conda-forge estnltk

The alternative way for installing if you are unable to use the anaconda
distribution is:

``python -m pip install estnltk``

This is slower, more error-prone and requires you to have the
appropriate compilers for building the scientific computation packages
for your platform.

Find more details in the `installation
tutorial <http://estnltk.github.io/estnltk/1.4/tutorials/installation.html>`__.

Documentation

Release 1.4 documentation is available at
