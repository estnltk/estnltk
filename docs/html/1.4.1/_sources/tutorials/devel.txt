Estnltk developer guide
=======================

This document is for everyone who is working on Estnltk project (or
wishes to work), but do not know how to get started.

Compiling estnltk
-----------------

::

    python setup.py build
    python3 setup.py build

Version control and branches
----------------------------

We have three repositories where we store Estnltk code: you should
push/pull every time from all of them to make them synced.

First, modify your ``.git/setup`` configuration to look like following:

[core]
    repositoryformatversion = 0
    filemode = true
    bare = false
    logallrefupdates = true
[remote "github"]
    url = git@github.com:estnltk/estnltk.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/github/*
[remote "ut"]
    url = git@estnltk.cs.ut.ee:timo/estnltk.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/ut/*
[remote "keeleressursid"]
    url = git@gitlab.keeleressursid.ee:timo-petmanson/estnltk.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/keeleressursid/*
[remote "origin"]
    url = git@github.com:estnltk/estnltk.git
    url = git@estnltk.cs.ut.ee:timo/estnltk.git
    url = git@gitlab.keeleressursid.ee:timo-petmanson/estnltk.git
[branch "master"]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/master
[branch "devel"]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/devel

Second, use commands:

::

    git push origin master
    git pull origin master

to perform pulls and pushes to both repositories without no extra
hassle.

Third, your're done! ;)

Checking out devel branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try this:

::

    git branch -a
    git checkout -t devel origin/devel
    git pull
    git checkout devel
    git branch -a

You should see something similar as output:

* devel
  master
  timo_dev
  remotes/github/devel
  remotes/github/gh-pages
  remotes/github/master
  remotes/github/timo_dev
  remotes/keeleressursid/devel
  remotes/keeleressursid/master
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/ut/devel
  remotes/ut/master

Important thing is that you see ``"* devel"`` .

Writing documentation
---------------------

Documentation resides under docs folder of estnltk and is generated
using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ document generator.

Setting up Sphinx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install Sphinx on your system, issue following commands:

::

    sudo pip3 install Sphinx
    sudo pip3 install numpydoc

Next, open file ``docs/conf.py`` and find the line:

sys.path.insert(0, '/home/timo/projects/estnltk')

Add a second line there, which tells where estnltk is installed on your
system. For example, if your user name is ``estnltkdeveloper`` and
estnltk is in your home folder, add:

sys.path.insert(0, '/home/estnltkdeveloper/estnltk')

After that, move to the docs folder and run:

::

    make html

Now Sphinx builds the documentation and stores it in ``docs/build/html``
subfolder.

Distributing the documentation to Github pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you type ``git branch -a``, you should see a remote branch
``remotes/github/gh-pages`` containing content that is served at
http://estnltk.github.io/estnltk/ . This branch does not contain any
code, so check it out into another directory in order to work with it.
Then, create a subfolder with the appropriate estnltk version and copy
the new documentation there.

Creating releases
-----------------

Linux
~~~~~

::

    ./clean.sh
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py build # yes, two times for now!
    python setup.py bdist_wheel
    python setup.py sdist
    python setup.py upload

Windows
~~~~~~~

To be able to build on Windows, you will need to install a compatible
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler for each version of Python. For more
details please refer to https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers.

**Compiling with Python 2.7**

Install Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 from
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266

32-bit:

::

    call "C:\Users\distorti\AppData\Local\Programs\Common\Microsoft\Visual C++ for Python\9.0\vcvarsall.bat" x86

64-bit:

::

    call "C:\Users\distorti\AppData\Local\Programs\Common\Microsoft\Visual C++ for Python\9.0\vcvarsall.bat x64

Then build as usual:

::

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py bdist_wheel

**Compiling with Python 3.4**

Install Microsoft Visual C++ 10.0 compiler as described at
https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers

32-bits:

::

    call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd" /x86

64-bits:

::

    call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd" /x64

If you stumble across an error like

    ... c:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Visual Studio
    10.0VCINCLUDEintrin.h(26) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include
    file: 'ammintrin.h': No such file or ...

you are missing a file "ammintrin.h" in "c:Program Files (x86)Microsoft
Visual Studio 10.0VCINCLUDE". As a quick fix, download it from
http://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/90383-fix-problem-when-mex-cpp-file.

Then build as usual:

::

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py bdist_wheel

**Compiling with Python 3.5**

Install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 compiler as described at
https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers

32-bit:

::

    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools\vcbuildtools.bat" x86

64-bit:

::

    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools\vcbuildtools.bat" x64

TODO: Currently this fails for some reason

Then build as usual:

::

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py bdist_wheel
