Estnltk developer guide
=======================

This document is for everyone who is working on Estnltk project (or wishes to work), but do not know how to get started.



Compiling estnltk
=================

::

    python setup.py build
    python3 setup.py build


Version control and branches
============================

We have three repositories where we store Estnltk code: you should push/pull every time from all of them
 to make them synced.

First, modify your ``.git/setup`` configuration to look like following::

    [core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
    [remote "github"]
        url = git@github.com:estnltk/estnltk.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/github/*
    [remote "ut"]
        url = git@estnltk.cs.ut.ee:timo/estnltk.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/ut/*
    [remote "keeleressursid"]
        url = git@gitlab.keeleressursid.ee:timo-petmanson/estnltk.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/keeleressursid/*
    [remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com:estnltk/estnltk.git
        url = git@estnltk.cs.ut.ee:timo/estnltk.git
        url = git@gitlab.keeleressursid.ee:timo-petmanson/estnltk.git
    [branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
    [branch "devel"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/devel

Second, use commands::

    git push origin master
    git pull origin master

to perform pulls and pushes to both repositories without no extra hassel.

Third, your're done! ;)


Checking out devel branch
-------------------------

Try this::

    git branch -a
    git checkout -t devel origin/devel
    git pull
    git checkout devel
    git branch -a

You should see something similar as output::

    * devel
      master
      timo_dev
      remotes/github/devel
      remotes/github/gh-pages
      remotes/github/master
      remotes/github/timo_dev
      remotes/keeleressursid/devel
      remotes/keeleressursid/master
      remotes/origin/master
      remotes/ut/devel
      remotes/ut/master

Important thing is that you see ``"* devel"`` .

Writing documentation
=====================

Documentation resides under `docs` folder of estnltk and is generated using `Sphinx`_ document generator.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/

Setting up Sphinx
-----------------

To install Sphinx on your system, issue following commands::

    sudo pip3 install Sphinx
    sudo pip3 install numpydoc

Next, open file ``docs/conf.py`` and find the line::

    sys.path.insert(0, '/home/timo/projects/estnltk')

Add a second line there, which tells where estnltk is installed on your system.
For example, if your user name is ``estnltkdeveloper`` and estnltk is in your home folder, add::

    sys.path.insert(0, '/home/estnltkdeveloper/estnltk')


After that, move to the docs folder and run::

    make html

Now Sphinx builds the documentation and stores it in ``docs/build/html`` subfolder.


Distributing the documentation to Github pages
----------------------------------------------

If you type ``git branch -a``, you should see a remote branch ``remotes/github/gh-pages``
containing content that is served at http://estnltk.github.io/estnltk/ .
This branch does not contain any code, so check it out into another directory in order to work with it.
Then, create a subfolder with the appropriate estnltk version and copy the new documentation there.


Creating releases
=================

Linux
-----
::

    ./clean.sh
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py build # yes, two times for now!
    python setup.py bdist_wheel
    python setup.py sdist
    python setup.py upload

Windows
-------

To be able to build on Windows, you will need to install a compatible Microsoft Visual C++ compiler for each version of Python. For more details please refer to https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers.

**Compiling with Python 2.7**

Install Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266

32-bit::
    
    call "C:\Users\distorti\AppData\Local\Programs\Common\Microsoft\Visual C++ for Python\9.0\vcvarsall.bat" x86
    
64-bit::

    call "C:\Users\distorti\AppData\Local\Programs\Common\Microsoft\Visual C++ for Python\9.0\vcvarsall.bat x64

Then build as usual::

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py bdist_wheel


**Compiling with Python 3.4**

Install Microsoft Visual C++ 10.0 compiler as described at https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers

32-bits::
    
    call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd" /x86

64-bits::

    call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd" /x64

If you stumble across an error like

    ... c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\INCLUDE\intrin.h(26) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'ammintrin.h': No such file or ...

you are missing a file "ammintrin.h" in "c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\INCLUDE".
As a quick fix, download it from http://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/90383-fix-problem-when-mex-cpp-file.

Then build as usual::

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py bdist_wheel


**Compiling with Python 3.5**

Install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 compiler as described at https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers

32-bit::

    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools\vcbuildtools.bat" x86

64-bit::

    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools\vcbuildtools.bat" x64

TODO: Currently this fails for some reason

Then build as usual::
    
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py bdist_wheel
