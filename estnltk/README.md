EstNLTK -- Open source tools for Estonian natural language processing
=====================================================================

EstNLTK provides common natural language processing functionality such as paragraph, sentence and word tokenization,
morphological analysis, named entity recognition, etc. for the Estonian language.

The project is funded by EKT ([Eesti Keeletehnoloogia Riiklik Programm](https://www.keeletehnoloogia.ee/)).

This package contains EstNLTK's basic linguistic analysis, system and database tools:

* `Text` class with the Estonian NLP pipeline;
* tokenization tools: word, sentence and paragraph tokenization; clause segmentation; 
* morphology tools: morphological analysis and disambiguation, spelling correction, morphological synthesis and syllabification, HFST based analyser and GT converter;
* information extraction tools: addresses tagger, named entity recognizer, temporal expression tagger; tools for rule based and grammar based fact extraction;
* experimental taggers: verb chain detector, noun phrase chunker, adjective phrase tagger;
* syntactic analysis tools: preprocessing for syntactic analysis, VislCG3 and Maltparser based syntactic parsers;
* Estonian Wordnet and Collocation-Net;
* web taggers -- such as bert embeddings web tagger, stanza syntax web tagger and stanza ensemble syntax web tagger;
* corpus importing tools -- tools for importing data from large Estonian corpora, such as the Reference Corpus or the National Corpus of Estonia;
* system taggers -- regex tagger, disambiguator, atomizer, merge tagger etc;
* utils for downloading additional resources (e.g. model files required by taggers); 
* Postgres database tools;

## Version 1.7

### Installation

EstNLTK is available for osx, windows-64, and linux-64, and for python versions 3.7 to 3.10. 
You can install the latest version via PyPI:

```
pip install estnltk==1.7.1
```

Alternatively, you can install EstNLTK via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Installation steps with conda:

1. [create a conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) with python 3.8, for instance:
```
conda create -n py38 python=3.8
```

2. [activate the environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment), for instance:
```
conda activate py38
```

3. install EstNLTK with the command:
```
conda install -c estnltk -c conda-forge estnltk=1.7.1
```

_Note_: for using some of the tools in estnltk, you also need to have Java installed in your system. We recommend using Oracle Java http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html, although alternatives such as OpenJDK (http://openjdk.java.net/) should also work.

### Using on Google Colab

You can install EstNLTK on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) environment via command:

```
!pip install estnltk==1.7.1
```

### Documentation

EstNLTK's tutorials come in the form of [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org).

  * [Starting point of tutorials](https://github.com/estnltk/estnltk/tree/main/tutorials)
  
Additional educational materials on EstNLTK are available on web pages of an NLP course taught at the University of Tartu:

  * [https://github.com/d009/EstNLP](https://github.com/d009/EstNLP) (in Estonian)  

Note: if you have trouble viewing jupyter notebooks in github (you get an error message _Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?_ at loading a notebook), then try to open notebooks with the help of [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org)
