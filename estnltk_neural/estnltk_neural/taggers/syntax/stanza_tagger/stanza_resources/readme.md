resources.json is a resource index file used by stanza, and should be included stanza's resource directory in order to successfully load models.

EstNLTK's stanza models are described in EstNLTK's resources index: from https://github.com/estnltk/estnltk_resources

StanzaSyntaxTagger and StanzaSyntaxEnsembleTagger attempt to automatically download resources if they are initialized without resource_path parameter.
